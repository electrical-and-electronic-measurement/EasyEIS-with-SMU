[Keithley 2400 SMU instruments series](https://www.tek.com/keithley-source-measure-units/keithley-smu-2400-series-sourcemeter) offer four-quadrant precision voltage and current source/load coupled with measurement with interactive touchscreen user interface, remote operation interface and and extensive scripting capability. These instruments can simultaneously source and measure current and voltage in two wire or four wire wiring schematics.

For this project a [2450 model](https://www.tek.com/datasheet/smu-2400-graphical-sourcemeter/model-2450-touchscreen-source-measure-unit-smu-instrument-) already available in the lab was used.
